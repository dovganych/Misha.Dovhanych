	<p>From two thousand feet, where <b>Claudette</b> <i>Sanders</i> was taking a flying lesson, the town of <small>Chester's Mill</small> gleamed in the morning light like something freshly made and just set down.<wbr> Cars trundled along <strong>Main Street</strong>, <em>flashing</em> up winks of sun.<wbr> The steeple of the Congo Church looked sharp enough to pierce the unblemished sky.<wbr> <mark>The sun raced along the surface of Prestile Stream as the Seneca V overflew it, both plane and water cutting the town on the same diagonal course.</mark></p>
